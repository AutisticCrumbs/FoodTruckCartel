This is the prototype for the world design.

Measurements are given as X meters by Y meters by Z meters

The player is 1m x 2m x 1m

The room layout is 10m x 3m x 10m

The window is 5m x 2m x 1m

The stove is 1.6m x 1m x 1.6m

The left countertop is 1.6m x 1m x 6.8m

The sink is 1.6m x 1m x 1.6m

The right countertop is 1.6m x 1m x 8m

The cutting board is 0.8m x 0.01m x 1.2m and is rotated +7 degrees on the Y axis

The refrigerator is 1.6m x m x m

NOTES:
The room layout *could* be pushed inwards by a little bit (I'd say about 1.8m total to make the 
appliances and the countertops flush with the window), but it is up to the group to decide.

This took about an hour-ish to make. It was easy to put together. I had an easy time making the 
appliances and countertops due to their cubic natures. It was nothing too complex when it comes to 
building the world. I even added a ground and a 'person' outside the kitchen area to show a bit of 
what the full world can/would look like outside the kitchen window.

It took a bit longer than expected, as I was very picky with the size of the appliances and 
countertops, so I'd say that it would have been about 45 minutes at the latest to put this together.
If it came down to removing coloring any any minor details that I put in this, I would knock off 
another 5 or so minutes.
